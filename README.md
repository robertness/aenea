## A Bayesian package covering approaches to analysing big data in the context of the Internet

*Topics Covered*

* Standard statistical methods for A/B testing using static experimental design is typically dominated (in terms of cost) by sequential methods based on Thompson sampling.  
* The use of Thompson sampling to motivate standard low dimensional statistical modeling such as beta-binomial, Poisson-gamma and normal-normal models.  
* Monte Carlo method for computing with Bayesian models, including Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings, and slice sampling.
* Handling the testing of multiple factors and contextual factors within the Thompson sampling framework by extending the reward distribution to GLMs.  T
* Bayesian regression in linear and generalized linear models using data augmentation.  
* Sparse models for testing large numbers of factors. 
* Working with real time data eg monthly or quarterly time series using dynamic linear models.
* Distribution across several machines.
